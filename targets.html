<br>

<p > SDG 2.1 Indicators
<br><BR>
1. Prevalence of Undernourishment This is the proportion of population whose energy intake over a certain period averages less than what is needed to meet minimum requirements.<br>

2. Prevalence of food insecurity It is measured by the food insecurity experience scale, which measures an individual's perception concerning the level of food insecurity in the population.<br><br></p>

<p>
Eradication of Hunger Commitment<br><BR>

Under subobjective SDG 2.1, it is the aim of the international community to have Zero Hunger. This would ensure that by 2030 nobody has hunger and all people enjoy safe and nutritious food throughout the year, especially the poor and vulnerable.<br>
<BR>
Among other reasons, under SDG 2.1, conflicts, climatic issues, and economic challenges deny 735 million people their opportunity to proper and nutritious food. Vulnerability policy adopted in partnership with communities under the SDG 2 carries a targeting of vulnerable as the approach to expose the root cause of food insecurity.
<br> <br><br>
Key Focus Areas
<br><br>
There are considerable themes: Humanitarian Funding Gap: The funds raised will be put into creating an appropriate response to the food crisis. Famine response is an expedited response to more acute food shortage. Building Resilience: Shock-responsive social protection and anticipatory measures to lessen the impact of a crisis. Nutrition is the practice of nutrition in humanitarian work to enhance health.

<h2 style="padding-top: 20;"><b>By 2030, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species.
</b></h2>
<br><BR>
<p>This would also include seed and plant banks, properly managed and diversified at national, regional, and international levels, as well as to promote equitable access to the sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources and indigenous knowledge associated with that, as internationally agreed.<br><br>

This has significantly lowered the number of plant and animal species that are cultivated for food intake. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides may also poison soils. Healthy soils are tiny ecosystems with millions of microbes and bacteria; it is, therefore, possible to grow nutrient-dense foods in such soils. Such soils can also hold much atmospheric carbon, make them more resilient during severe drought and other harsh weather events, and reduce soil erosion. The diversity in diets based on biodiverse soils provides the optimal micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary for the nutrition of human beings.</p>
